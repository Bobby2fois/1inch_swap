# ðŸš€ ETH â‡„ SCR Swap

A minimal frontend interface to swap ETH for USDC using on-chain price data (via 1inch or Chainlink), with support for Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs), resolvers, relayers, and bi-directional cross-chain swaps between Ethereum and Scroll.

This project is an implementation of a trustless, atomic swap system inspired by 1inch Fusion, extended to work cross-chain. It uses LayerZero messaging and dual-escrow contracts to enable swaps with real-time pricing, off-chain order resolution, and partial fills. It also introduces a Dutch auction resolver model that incentivizes reliable behavior.

## Key Features

* Bi-directional atomic swaps between Ethereum and Scroll using HTLCs
* Real-time pricing from 1inch or Chainlink APIs
* Off-chain relayer/resolver design to verify and settle swaps
* Refunds for expired swaps
* Partial fill support (via off-chain logic)
* Audited smart contracts inspired by OpenZeppelin and 1inch best practices
* Forked local testing with Foundry and Anvil

## Upcoming Features

* Dutch auction pricing model to reward fast, trusted resolvers
* UI improvements to visualize order lifecycle and auction curve
* On-chain resolver reputation system
* Multi-asset support beyond ETH/USDC
* Bridge-less swaps to additional chains beyond Scroll
* Secure off-chain coordination layer with Redis

## Why We're Eligible

We meet all qualification requirements:

* Hashlock and timelock preserved for HTLC-based swaps
* Bi-directional swap support between Ethereum and Scroll
* Fully demoed using testnet deployments on Scroll Sepolia and Ethereum Sepolia
* Contract code and UI both support partial fills

We have studied 1inchâ€™s open-source codebase and audits via OpenZeppelin to ensure security and architectural alignment with Fusion+. This project was designed with extensibility and real-world application in mind.
